## Your personal effectivity booster
Generative AI is considered to bring the next Industrial Revolution.

Why? Studies show a **37% efficiency boost** in day to day work activities!

#### What is this app?
This app is a Chat Agent which takes into account Enterprise Context to provide meaningfull and contextual responses.
Why is this a big thing? It is because the underlying Foundational Large Language Models are not trained on Enterprise Data. They have no way of knowing anything about your organization.
Also they are trained upon a moment in time, so typically miss out on relevant and recent information.

#### What does it know?
The app has been preloaded with the following context:
- [PDF met Business Principles](https://www.postnl.nl/Images/business-principles-nl_tcm10-66407.pdf)
- [PDF met haalservice aanbod](https://www.postnl.nl/Images/aanleveren-pakketten_tcm10-236964.pdf)
- [Webpagina over zakelijk aanbod](https://www.postnl.nl/zakelijke-oplossingen/)
- [Webpagina over duurzaamheid](https://www.postnl.nl/zakelijke-oplossingen/duurzaamheid/)

This means you can start interacting with your personal assistant based on the above topics.

#### Adding additional context
On top of the above you have the opportunity to add additional information which then can be taken into account by the personal assistant. Just drop a PDF or Text file into the upload box in the sidebar and hit `Save`.

By the way... Be careful with the `Delete context` button. As this will do exactly that. I deletes the preloaded content mentioned above rendering the personal assistant non-contextual ðŸ˜‰
